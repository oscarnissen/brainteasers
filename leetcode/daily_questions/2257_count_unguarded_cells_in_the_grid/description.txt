You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.

A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.

Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

 

Example 1:


Input: m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The guarded and unguarded cells are shown in red and green respectively in the above diagram.
There are a total of 7 unguarded cells, so we return 7.
Example 2:


Input: m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]], walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The unguarded cells are shown in green in the above diagram.
There are a total of 4 unguarded cells, so we return 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 105
2 <= m * n <= 105
1 <= guards.length, walls.length <= 5 * 104
2 <= guards.length + walls.length <= m * n
guards[i].length == walls[j].length == 2
0 <= rowi, rowj < m
0 <= coli, colj < n
All the positions in guards and walls are unique.

Solution plan:
All occupied cells are cells that isnt occupied by a guard or a wall, and isnt seen by a guard.

Steps:
0.) Create mxn board with zeros
1.) Mark tiles with guards and walls as 1.
2.) Mark tiles that can be seen by a guard as 1.
3.) Check all tiles on board that are not marked as 1 and count
